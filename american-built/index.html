<p>This application was built 100% in the United States of America by USA engineers, humans or otherwise normal
  citizens.</p>

<p>We live in a world where companies are constantly cutting costs, taking shortcuts and ruining American lives by
  hiring cheap,
  unreliable and poor quality overseas engineers. This application and any with the same "American Built" seal are
  built entirely by citizens of the United States of America who are invested in the future of the product and the
  company.</p>

<p>An "American Built" application can vary from a proof of concept to "tried it for the sake of learning" all the
  way to a full enterprise application. I don't want anyone to feel that their work isn't good enough for this label,
  all works built and created by citizens of the United States of America are welcome to put this badge onto their
  work.</p>

<p>If you and your company value the quality of your product, employ amazing American engineers and actually care
  about the life you are able to provide to the people you employ, I invite you to place the "American Built"
  badge on your application.</p>
